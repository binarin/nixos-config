Each module should be self-contained and explicitly import all its dependencies. Need to also develop a testing strategy to verify this (e.g., try loading each module in isolation).","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-05T17:05:01.166001257+01:00","updated_at":"2025-12-05T17:05:01.166001257+01:00"}
